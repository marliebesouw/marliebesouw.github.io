Through its network of AI labs, ICAI enables research that directly impacts real-world applications, including healthcare, business, and societal challenges. <br>

    A key challenge in healthcare is not just deciding whether to buy or build an AI solution, but also how to select and successfully implement it. This course provides practical insights, real-world case studies, and hands-on experience to help professionals navigate the entire AI adoption process. By bringing together healthcare experts, AI vendors, and researchers, we aim to equip participants with the knowledge and tools needed to make informed choices and ensure successful integration of AI in clinical practice.
