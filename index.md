    Artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing, but successful adoption in healthcare settings remains complex. This course is designed to bridge that gap: connecting ideas with implementation. <br>

    A key challenge in healthcare is not just deciding whether to buy or build an AI solution, but also how to select and <strong>successfully implement</strong> it. This course provides <strong>practical insights, real-world case studies, and hands-on experience</strong> to help professionals navigate the entire AI adoption process. By bringing together <strong>healthcare experts, AI vendors, and researchers</strong>, we aim to equip participants with the knowledge and tools needed to make informed choices and ensure successful integration of AI in clinical practice.<br><br>
