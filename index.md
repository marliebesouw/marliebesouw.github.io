      Everyone talks about AI, but how do you choose the right one? And how do you actually use it in your clinic? <br>

      On <strong>September 19</strong>, join clinicians, medical physicists, and AI experts to explore how AI is being used in hospitals today. Learn how to collaborate with vendors, evaluate tools, and apply AI responsibly. <br><br>

      This congress offers:
      <ul>
       <li>Real-world use cases from radiology, radiotherapy, cardiology, and pathology</li>
       <li>Hands-on workshops with <a href="{{ site.url }}/speakers" > <i>leading experts</i></a></li>
       <li>Practical tools to select and implement AI solutions</li>
      </ul>

    Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or navigating implementation, this day gives you the clarity and confidence to move forward.


   <h3> About the Course</h3>
    This congress is designed to provide clinicians, medical physicists and technicians with real-world applications of AI practical insights on <strong>the critical decision of buying, building, selecting, and implementing AI solutions for healthcare</strong>. Through a combination of expert talks, hands-on workshops, and real-world case studies, participants will gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities, challenges, and key considerations when integrating AI into clinical workflows.
    <h3> ICAI </h3>
   This day is organized by <a href="https://www.icai.ai/" target="_blank">ICAI</a> (Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence), as part of the ROBUST inititative for trustworthy AI. 
    ICAI is a national initiative focused on AI talent development and research collaboration in the Netherlands. ICAI bridges the gap between academia, industry, and healthcare by <strong>fostering partnerships that drive cutting-edge AI innovations</strong>.
